        <p>I thrive off the joy a great hairstyle can bring someone. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with my clients, new and upcoming stylists as well as those who have been in the industry for years. I am always creating! Outside of the salon I am a jewellery maker and a silversmith apprentice. I am also an avid yogini and am excited to take my Yoga Teacher training Autumn 2017!
