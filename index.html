          <p>I thrive off the joy a great hairstyle can bring someone. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with my clients, new and upcoming stylists as well as those who have been in the industry for years.</p> <p>I am always creating! Outside of the salon I enjoy making jewellery as well as herb infused healing oils and balms! Check out my Etsy page below!
             I am also an avid yogini and am excited to have completed my 200 Hour Yoga Teacher training at my home studio, here in Toronto, Mula Yoga. You'll have to come and take a class with me! Stay tuned for details.
