 <ul> <li>Haircutting, colouring and styling on all hair types</li>
      <li>Upstyling for weddings and other special occasions</li>
  <li>Complimentary consultations for major colour work and peace of mind</li>
  <li> Ask me about getting your make up done as well! </li>
 
 </ul>

 <p> I make. I make jewellery. I Shibori dye everything white. I infuse oils with herbs to create healing salves and balms. Doing this brings me peace and satisfaction. I love working with healing stones,crystals,herbs and dyes.I am currenlty doing a silversmith apprenticeship and I look forward to incorporating these peices in my collection in the next year</p>
