        <p>I thrive off the joy a great hairstyle can bring someone. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with new and upcoming stylists as well as those who have been in the industry for years to set them up for success in the salon.</p>I am also an avid yogini and am excited to take my Yoga Teacher training Autumn 2017! I also further my roster of creativity with a silversmith apprenticeship and jewellery making.
