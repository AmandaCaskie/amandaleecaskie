        <p>I thrive off the joy a great hairstyle can bring someone. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with my cleints, new and upcoming stylists as well as those who have been in the industry for years. I am also a jewellery maker and am currently taking a silversmith apprenticeship. I am an avid yogini and am excited to take my Yoga Teacher training Autumn 2017!</div>
